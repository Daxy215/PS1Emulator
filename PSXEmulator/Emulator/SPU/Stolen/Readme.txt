This SPU implementation is taken from: https://github.com/JaCzekanski/Avocado

Until I manage to implement my own SPU.
I copied it to get a chance at getting further with the emulator,
as most games require some aspects of SPU to be implemented,
and I have never implemented anything to do with Sounds and it's scary.
