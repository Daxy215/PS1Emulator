/* List of problems;
 * Wrapped_add and wrapped_sub were returning the wrong values,
    * in the end, I learnt that the default c++ behaviour,
    * handles this problem, so I just returned a simple sum of the two
    
 * wrong pc counting.. MANY.. MANY different times
    * (Future me here; Had even more PC problems) 
    * This also caused the program to read the wrong instructions
    * and skip some..
    
 * checked_add -> caused a problem of returning overflow when it shouldn't
 * instruction -> imm_see returns the wrong value
    * Can't remember exactly why, but after a bunch of debugging,
    * I found out that I had a bug somewhere else
     
 * sub instruction -> Was using wrappingadd instead of wrappingsub..

/**
 * Where I got the BIOS from:
 * https://myrient.erista.me/files/Redump/Sony%20-%20PlayStation%20-%20BIOS%20Images/
 *
 * Needed the ps-22a which is the SCPH-1001 version.
 */

/** IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 * PS1 uses the MIPS instruction set.
 * Each instruction is exactly 32 bits long or 4 bytes.
 
 * Initial value of PC is 0xbfc00000(The beginning of the BIOS)
 
 * ONLY one DEVICE can access the BUS at a time! (TODO; Research why future me)
 * The DMA can only copy data between the RAM and a device!!
 *
 * COPIED!!
 * Implementing complete and accurate DMA support can be quite tricky. The
 * main problem is that in certain modes the DMA sporadically gives back the
 * control to the CPU. For instance while the GPU is busy processing a command
 * and won’t accept any new input the DMA has to wait. Instead of wasting time
 * it gives back control to the CPU to give it the opportunity to do something else.
 * In order to emulate this behaviour correctly we need to emulate the GPU
 * command FIFO, DMA timings and CPU timings correctly. Then we need to
 * setup the state machine to switch between the CPU and DMA when needed.
 * That would require quite some work to get right and we only have the BIOS
 * boot logo to test it at this point.
 * To avoid having to implement all that we’re going to make a simplifying
 * assumption for now: when the DMA runs it does all the transfer at once without
 * giving back control to the CPU. This won’t be exactly accurate but it should
 * suffice to run the BIOS and hopefully some games.
 * The reason I feel confident doing this simplification is that PCSX-R seems to
 * do it that way and it can run quite many games, although some comments hint
 * that it breaks with certain titles and it uses some hacks to improve compatibility.
 * Mednafen on the other hand implements a much accurate DMA and actually
 * emulates the DMA giving back the control to the CPU in certain situations,
 * we’ll probably want to do something similar later on.
 * For now let’s take a few steps back and revisit all the DMA register reads
 * and writes done by the BIOS so that we can emulate them correctly.
 * 
 * https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/dmachannels/#dma-register-summary
 * 
 * There 7 DMA channels:
    * Channel 0 -> Is used to connect to the Media Decoder input
    * Channel 1 -> Is used to connect to the Media Decoder output
    * Channel 2 -> Is used to connect to the GPU
    * Channel 3 -> Is used to connect to the CDROM drive
    * Channel 4 -> Is used to connect to the SPU
    * Channel 5 -> Is used to connect to the extension port
    * Channel 6 -> Is used to connect to the RAM and is used to clear an "ordering table"
    
 * DMA Channel Control register description
    * Field bits        Description
    * 0                 Transfer direction: RAM-to-device(0) or device-RAM(1)
    * 1                 Address increment(0) or decrement(1) mode
    * 2                 Chopping mode
    * [10:9]            Synchronization type: Manual(0), Request(1) or Linked List(2)
    * [18:16]           Chopping DMA window
    * [22:20]           Chopping CPU window
    * 24                Enable
    * 28                Manual trigger
    * [30:29]           Unknown
    * 
    * PAGE 28 for more information
    
 * The PS1 uses little-endian formation for storing data.
    * As they store the least significant byte first.
    
 * MIPS R3000 CPU can support up to 4 coprocessors:
    * Coprocessor 0 (cop0):
        * Is basically used for exception handling.
        
    * Coprocessor 1 (cop1):
        * Is an optional coprocessor that is available for floating points arithmetic usage.
        
    * Coprocessor 2 (cop2):
        * Seems to be custom-made for the Playstation? However, it's called,
        * Geometry Transformation Engine (GTE). Used for... 3D stuff, such as,
        * perspectives, transformations, matrices etc..
         
    * Coprocessor 3 (cop3):
        * This one isn't really implemented on the Playstation.
 */

/** More registers information
 * $cop0 3 is BPC, used to generate a breakpoint exception when,
    * the PC takes the given value.
    
 * $cop0 5 is BDA, the data breakpoint. It’s like BPC except it breaks when
    * a certain address is accessed on a data load/store instead of a PC value.
    
 * $cop0 6: No information was found regarding this register
    
 * $cop0 7 is DCIC, used to enable and disable the various hardware breakpoints.
 * $cop0 9 is BDAM, it’s a bitmask applied when testing for BDA above.
    * That way we could trigger on a range of address instead of a single one.
    
 * $cop0 11 is BPCM, like BDAM but for masking the BPC breakpoint.
 * $cop0 12 we’ve already encountered: it’s SR, the status register.
 * $cop0 13 is CAUSE, which contains mostly read-only data describing the
    * cause of an exception. Apparently only bits [9:8] are writable to force an exception.

 * Please note this is NOT written by me.

 * $zero register;

        * If an instruction attempts to load a value in this register,
        * it doesn't do anything, the register will still be 0 afterwards.
            * It can be used to reduce the size of the instruction as it's a constant 0.
        * For instance, moving a value from $v0 to $a0 you can do;
            * move $a0, $v0
        * However the "move" instruction is not part of the MIPS instruction set.
        * It's just a conveninet shorthand understood by the assembler which,
        * which will generate the equivalent instruction;
            * addu $a0, $v0, $zero
        * We can see that it is effectively does the same thing as the previous instruction,
        * but we are avoid to implement a dedicated "move" instruction in the CPU.
        
 * The $ra register;
    * $ra ($31) is the other general purpose register given a special meaning by the hardware,
    * since instructions like "jump and link" or "branch and link" put the return address,
